  # Fix food_entries table access and RLS policies

  1. Security Changes
    - Enable RLS on food_entries table
    - Add policy for anonymous users to insert their own data
    - Add policy for anonymous users to read their own data
  
  2. Table Updates
    - Ensure all columns have proper defaults where needed
    - Add any missing constraints

  This migration fixes the "Failed to fetch" error when saving food entries
  by properly configuring Row Level Security policies.
